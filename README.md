# decompile module script #

an open source decompiler for `ModuleScript` only no other instance like localscript 

EDIT AS OF 2/22 IT WORKS VERY **GOOD** YOU NEED TO USE `v2.lua` its BETTER.

# NEEDS REQUIRE FUNCTION #

**TODO** reformat the decompile output cleaner like an actual modulescript. if u do it make sure to @ here or msg me on dc would love it :))

# the story

as i was making a games gun modification i wanted to return all the Keys inside of a guns module but i thought *why not just make a decompile func* with this?

it works similar but its not exact. this actually can be used INSTEAD of your garbage getscriptbytecode and send it to Konstant..✅✅
